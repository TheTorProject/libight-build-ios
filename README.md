# Libight build iOS

This repository contains the code to cross-compile libight for iOS. Provided
that you have Xcode installed, it should suffice to run

    ./build.sh

to have static library and headers compiled below the `dist` directory.

## Setup

Run:
    
    git submodule update --init
    cd libight/
    git submodule update --init
